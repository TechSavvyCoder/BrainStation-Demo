# Exercise: Terminal

## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to practice using common terminal commands to interact with directories and files. Use the Terminal lecture slides and Google to help you if you are not sure which command, flag, or argument to use to perform a given task.

To get started, please download and unzip the starter files [here](https://api.brainstation.io/content/link/1YYRqwKYMVC2ITZhk-8Rkx36ULZ8Q40Og?instanceId=6720).

## Instructions
Using only terminal commands, do the following:

* Navigate into your `Desktop` directory.
* Create a directory in your `Desktop` directory called `brainstation` if you do not already have one.
* Navigate into your `brainstation` directory and create a new directory called `vegetables`.
* Locate the directory where the `terminal_lab` directory was installed.
* Move the `vegetables.txt` file from the `terminal_lab` directory into the `vegetables` directory.
* Inside the `vegetables` directory, make a new file called `my_favorite.txt`. Use `echo` to write the name of your favorite vegetable inside.
* There's a secret file in the `terminal_lab` directory which tells you our favorite vegetable is. Make a copy of this file inside of the `vegetables` directory.
* After you've copied the secret file, delete the `terminal_lab` directory and all of its contents.
