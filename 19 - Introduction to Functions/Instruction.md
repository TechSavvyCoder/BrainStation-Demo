# Introduction to Functions

## Getting Started
- Download the following starter code package
- In this lab you will write your code in `script.js` and run it by opening `index.html` in the browser.
- Make sure to open the Chrome Inspector console to catch any errors. Here are some handy keyboard shortcuts to open devtools: [chrome-devtools/shortcuts](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts)
- You will inspect your results in the console.

For example:
```javascript
// example
let value = 8;
console.log(value);
```

## Exercises
1. Write a function called `avg` that...
    - Takes 3 numbers as parameters
    - Computes the average of the 3 numbers
    - Returns that average

2. Test your function by doing the following:
    - Create a test set of 3 numbers, compute the average by hand
    - Call your function and pass in the numbers as arguments
    - Store the value returned from your function as a variable
    - Print the returned value, stored in a variable, using `console.log`

3. Write a function called `isEqual` that...
    - Takes two strings as parameters
    - Compares the two strings for equivalence
    - Returns true if they are the same string, false if they are not the same string

4. Test your function by doing the following:
    - Create a test-set of strings that should return true
    - Create a test-set of strings that should return false
    - Store the value returned from your function as a variable
    - Print the returned value, stored in a variable, using `console.log`

5. Write a function called `output` that...
    - Takes one parameter
    - `console.log`s the passed parameter
    - Returns nothing
    - Test your function by checking the chrome console for your output
