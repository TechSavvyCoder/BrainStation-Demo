# Challenge: JavaScript Animations

## Directions
Please download the starter code. The code will include a minified JavaScript solution. The exercise is to write your own JavaScript to replicate the same animated effects.

Please be advised that the diving deeper section will require a basic understanding of JavaScript programming including if statements, which we will cover in the beginning of the next Chapter.
